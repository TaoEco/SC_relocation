This study aims to compare the levelized cost of stell (LCOS) under industrial relocation strategies with the conventional production process. 

Thus, we first constructed cost evaluation models for 7 supply chains, among which SC1-SC3 are illustrating the relocation strategy. 
Then, we analyzed the composition items of Levelized cost of steel (LCOS), detected the dominant factors affecting the uncertainty of LCOS.
lastly, we systematically compared the LCOS in various scenarios under policy targets and technology scenarios to assess the relative policy implications.![image](https://github.com/TaoEco/SC_relocation/assets/51190280/50c11df6-ace4-4795-a559-ac2f58de62c9)
